# Hey, its Robert Barragan,

## Thanks so much for checking out my portfolio!

First off I will try to create an html and CSS version of the project if all goes well I will use that template for the styling so I can use my skills in JQuery and javascript to make my website presentable. Overall the main information is on my page I just need to make styling and add pictures so the site looks nice.
